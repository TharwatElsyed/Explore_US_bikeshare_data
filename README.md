<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="4" data-line-end="5">In this project, I will use python to  to explore data related to bike share systems for three major cities in the United Statesâ€”Chicago, New York City, and Washington , write code to import the data and answer interesting questions about it by computing descriptive statistics. and will  write a script that takes in raw input to create an interactive experience in the terminal to present these statistics.</p>

<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="14" data-line-end="15">Randomly selected data for the first six months of 2017 are provided for all three cities. All three of the data files contain the same core six (6) columns:</p>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="16" data-line-end="23">Start Time<br>
End Time<br>
Trip Duration<br>
Start Station<br>
End Station<br>
User Type<br>
The Chicago and New York City files also have the following two columns:</p>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="24" data-line-end="26">Gender<br>
Birth Year</p>
<h2 class="code-line" data-line-start=26 data-line-end=27 ><a id="Answering_Questions_26"></a><strong>Answering Questions</strong></h2>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="27" data-line-end="28">answering the following questions about the bike share data:</p>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="29" data-line-end="38">What month occurs most often in the start time?<br>
What day of the week (Monday, Tuesday, etc.) occurs most often in the start time?<br>
What hour of the day occurs most often in the start time?<br>
What is the total trip duration and average trip duration?<br>
What is the most frequently used start station and most frequently used end station?<br>
What is the most common trip (i.e., the combination of start station and end station that occurs the most often)?<br>
What are the counts of each user type?<br>
What are the counts of gender?<br>
What is the earliest birth year (when the oldest person was born), most recent birth year, and most common birth year?</p>
